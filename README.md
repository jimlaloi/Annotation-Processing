# FrameNet annotation tools
This repository contains scripts I wrote to prepare and process data for my dissertation (*Diachronic dynamics of metonymy in French semantic frames*, UT Austin, 2020). I applied Frame Semantic annotation in the style of FrameNet to diachronic French data in 3 frames. The scripts contained here prepare the data for annotation using the [FrameNet Annotation Tool](https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnAnnoTool/) and process it post-annotation so it can be visualized and analyzed.
