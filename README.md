# FrameNet annotation tools
This repository contains scripts I wrote to prepare and process data for my dissertation (*Diachronic dynamics of metonymy in French semantic frames*, UT Austin, 2020). I applied Frame Semantic annotation in the style of FrameNet to diachronic French data in 3 frames. The scripts contained here prepare the data for annotation using the [FrameNet Annotation Tool](https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnAnnoTool/) and process it post-annotation so it can be visualized and analyzed.

Many of these scripts read or modify the data files available for download from the Berkeley FrameNet for English (https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/framenet_request_data) or from the ASFALDA FrameNet for French (http://asfalda.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/frameIndex.xml).

Some of these scripts work with language data from a variety of French corpora. Information and links to the relevant corpora are provided in the documentation for each of these scripts.
